# terminal_symbol.py
# We defined a class called Terminal

# a Terminal is just a string, here we rewrite the __hash__() method for this class

# We also define a function: generate_sentence(grammar_map) function
# * which accepts the grammar_map of file,
# * and then return the var_name in this class
