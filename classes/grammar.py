# grammar.py
# We defined a class called Grammar

# The Grammar class records all variable names and rules in the file
# * and combine them as a dictionary, grammar_map
# * the key of the map is Class Variable
# * the value of the map is Class Rule

# We also define a function: generate_sentence(start_variable, number_of_sentences) function
# * which accepts the name of start_variable,
# * the number of sentences expected to be output,
# * and then generates a series of sentences according to the rules
